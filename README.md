# Kivy-Astronomical-Photo-of-the-Day-App

This Kivy app fetches a NASA API that features a 
different astronomical photo every day. I have 
included the title of the photo as well as a 
button to pull up a pop-up screen that provides
more information about the image. I have used the
buildozer.spec file included in this repo to
build the APK on Google Colab and install the
working app on my phone.
